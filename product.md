# Product Document: HackerNews Job Posting Scraper Bot

## Overview
The objective is to create a bot that scrapes job postings from the monthly threads on HackerNews. This document outlines the requirements, assumptions, limitations, and knowledge prerequisites for developing such a bot.

### Requirements
- **Functionality**: The bot must scrape job postings from the specified HackerNews thread.
- **Output Format**: Data to be extracted and stored in CSV format.
- **Data Fields**: The bot will focus on extracting company name, URL, email, skill level, and technology set.
- **Integration with ChatGPT**: Utilize ChatGPT for parsing and organizing the scraped information, with the necessary API key.

### Assumptions
- **HackerNews Link**: A direct link to the HackerNews monthly thread will be provided.
- **File Management**: File operations will be limited to creating and reading CSV files, using the `fs` package.
- **ChatGPT Capability**: ChatGPT is assumed to be capable of parsing the scraped data effectively.

### Limitations & Recourses
- **Weird Email Formats**: In case of unconventional email formats, the recourse is to accept the limitation ("Oh well?").
- **Spelling Mistakes**: ChatGPT should be informed and made aware of potential spelling errors in the data.
- **False Positives**: Implementation of a filter for false keywords to minimize incorrect data scraping.
- **Cost Analysis**: To manage operational costs, the bot should not be set to run too frequently (e.g., not every five seconds).

### Knowledge Requirements
- **ChatGPT Prompt Writing**: Proficiency in creating effective prompts for ChatGPT is crucial.
- **Node.js Expertise**: In-depth knowledge of Node.js for backend development.
- **Execution Script**: The bot will be executed using the command `node index.js`.

### Packages
- **File System (fs)**: To handle file operations.
- **OpenAI Package**: To be used for integrating ChatGPT, available at [npmjs.com/package/openai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai).

### Additional Considerations
- **Scalability**: Ensure the bot can handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms for network issues, data inconsistencies, and API limitations.
- **User Interface**: If applicable, a simple user interface for initiating the scraping process and viewing logs.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and troubleshooting.
- **Compliance**: Adherence to legal and ethical guidelines related to web scraping and data usage.
